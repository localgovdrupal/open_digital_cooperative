# Becoming a Member of Open Digital Cooperative

When an organisation (or person) becomes eligible for membership the Membership Coordinator will contact them to ask whether they would like to be considered for membership.

## Application

A request to be considered for membership must be submitted, in writing, to Membership Coordinator, with the following information:
  - Their nominated representative,
  - Confirmation that they have read and accept [the seven principles of cooperation](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity),
  - Confirmation that they understand the responsibilities of membership of Open Digital Cooperative.

## Consideration

The Membership Coordinators will request feedback from exisiting members via a members-only Slack channel, with a timeframe of seven days to register concerns. After this, as per the Articles of Association, the directors will approve or reject the application. 

If accepted, the Membership Coordinator will inform the applicant, and will update the Membership Log.

The Membership Coordinator is responsible for ensuring the representative is added to the apporpriate communication channels.

## Terminating membership

If a member organisation stops being eligible for membership they will be removed as a member, and from member-only channels and documents. 

Any organisation may step down from membership at any time by informing, in writing, the Membership Coordinator. 

A member may be removed from membership by agreement from the other members at an AGM, as per the Articles of Association.
